# Test Project

This is a test project used by me to get a better understand of Git and Github. Guessing there won't be much that is useful here, other than in cementing my understanding.

## Another Heading

Even just learning the README.md formatting and how it integrates into GitHub is something.

### Yet Another Heading

> Son, we live in a world that has walls.

Checking the blockquote.

```
def hello_world():
    print 'Hello World!'
```
